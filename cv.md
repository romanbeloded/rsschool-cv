## Summary
My goal is to become professional web developer. I enjoy learn new languages, frameworks, and technologies in general. I want to be a part of the future of the 
technology industry and my organizational skills will play an essential role to keep my code clean as possible. The satisfaction of solving problems is what drives 
me to be a better programmer.
